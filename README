My dotfiles compilation

There is some really old "legacy" stuff that I don't use anymore, but is kept here as history.

This repository has been reset on 31/12/2018. The old repository lives on https://github.com/rafamoreira/dotfiles-old

# Especifics

## Ansible
There's a still incomplete playbook on the root of the directory that should bootstrap some configs on a fresh install more on that to come

## Tilix
Tilix uses dconf, so to import back the configs you have to do a `dconf load /com/gexperts/Tilix/ < tilix.conf` and `dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix > tilix.conf` to export.
